## 📅 **2025 Maintenance Log**

### **Entry #001 - Initial Migration & SSL Issues**
**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** HTTP 405 error with form submissions  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

**Problem Description:**
- User reported "Site not secure" and red HTTPS warnings
- Form submissions returned HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" error
- Netlify Forms not properly detected

**Root Cause:**
- Netlify Forms requires proper detection at build time
- Form attributes were incorrect (`data-netlify="true"` instead of `netlify`)
- Missing hidden form for Netlify's build-time detection

**Solution Applied:**
1. Added hidden form for Netlify detection:
   ```html
   <form name="newsletter-signup" netlify netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
       <input type="email" name="email" />
       <input name="bot-field" />
   </form>
   ```
2. Updated visible form attributes:
   ```html
   <form name="newsletter-signup" method="POST" netlify netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
   ```
3. Implemented ALIAS DNS record for better SSL handling

**Impact:**
- ✅ Forms now work correctly
- ✅ SSL certificates provisioned properly
- ✅ No more 405 errors
- ✅ Spam protection active via honeypot
- ✅ **VERIFIED: Form submission successful** (January 2025)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Netlify Forms requires hidden form for build-time detection
- ALIAS records are more reliable than A records for Netlify
- Local testing of forms is not possible with Netlify Forms

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Added hidden form, updated form attributes
- DNS records - Changed to ALIAS configuration

**Date:** January 2025

- "Projects" link pointed to non-existent `#projects` section
- Duplicate navigation items causing confusion

**Root Cause:**
- Inconsistent navigation structure
- Missing target sections for navigation links

**Solution Applied:**
1. Removed duplicate "Portfolio" link from navigation

3. Updated both desktop and mobile navigation consistently

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clean, consistent navigation
- ✅ No more broken links

### **Entry #003 - Documentation Organization**
**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Scattered documentation files  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  

**Problem Description:**
- Multiple .md files scattered in root directory
- No organized structure for maintenance documentation
- Need for systematic issue tracking

**Root Cause:**
- Ad-hoc documentation creation without structure
- No maintenance tracking system

**Solution Applied:**
1. Created organized docs directory structure:
   ```
   docs/
   ├── deployment/
   │   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md
   │   └── DNS_SETUP.md
   ├── troubleshooting/
   │   ├── FORM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   │   └── SSL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   ├── maintenance/
   │   └── MAINTENANCE_JOURNAL.md
   └── DEVELOPMENT.md
   ```
2. Moved all documentation to appropriate folders
3. Created this maintenance journal system

**Impact:**
- ✅ Organized documentation structure
- ✅ Easy access to troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Systematic issue tracking

**Lessons Learned:**
- Documentation structure should be planned from the start
- Maintenance tracking is crucial for long-term project health
- Organized docs improve team efficiency

**Files Modified:**
- Moved `DEPLOYMENT.md` → `docs/deployment/`
- Moved `DNS_SETUP.md` → `docs/deployment/`
- Moved `FORM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → `docs/troubleshooting/`
- Moved `SSL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → `docs/troubleshooting/`
