## ‚è±Ô∏è DNS Propagation Timeline

- **Initial propagation:** 5-15 minutes
- **Full global propagation:** 24-48 hours
- **Most users will see changes:** Within 1-2 hours

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### 1. Check DNS Propagation
Use these tools to verify your DNS is working:
- [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
- [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
- [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com)

### 2. Test Your Domain
- Visit `http://chawana.online` (should redirect to HTTPS)
- Visit `https://chawana.online` (should show your site)
- Visit `https://www.chawana.online` (should redirect to non-www)

### 3. Netlify Verification
1. Go back to Netlify **Domain Management**
2. Click **Verify** next to your domain
3. Status should change to **Verified** ‚úÖ

---

## üîí SSL Certificate Setup

Once DNS is verified:
1. Netlify will automatically provision an SSL certificate
2. This usually takes 5-10 minutes
3. Your site will be accessible via HTTPS
4. HTTP traffic will automatically redirect to HTTPS

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Domain not resolving:**
- Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- Check if you entered the correct Netlify site URL
- Verify TTL settings (lower = faster propagation)

**SSL certificate not working:**
- Ensure DNS is fully propagated first
- Check that both @ and www records are correct
- Wait up to 24 hours for certificate provisioning

**Redirects not working:**
- Check your `_redirects` file is in the root directory
- Verify Netlify has detected the redirects
- Clear browser cache

### DNS Record Verification

Make sure your records look exactly like this:

```
@    A    75.2.60.5
@    A    99.83.190.102
www  CNAME your-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Important:** Replace `your-site-name.netlify.app` with your actual Netlify site URL.

## üì± Mobile DNS Testing

Test on mobile devices:
1. Turn off WiFi (use cellular data)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Visit chawana.online
4. Should load your Netlify site

---

## üîÑ After DNS Setup

### 1. Update Netlify Settings
- Go to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Domain Management**
- Set `chawana.online` as primary domain
- Enable **Force HTTPS**

### 2. Test All Features

## üìû Support

### If DNS Setup Fails
1. **Check with your registrar** - some have specific requirements
2. **Contact Netlify support** - they can help with domain issues
3. **Use Netlify's DNS** - transfer DNS management to Netlify (easier option)

### Netlify DNS (Easier Alternative)
If you want to avoid DNS configuration:
1. Transfer DNS management to Netlify
2. Netlify handles all DNS records automatically
3. Just point your domain's nameservers to Netlify
