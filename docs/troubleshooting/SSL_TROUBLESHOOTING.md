- Try accessing from different networks/devices

### Fix 2: Verify DNS Records
**Problem:** Incorrect DNS configuration
**Solution:** Double-check your DNS records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5

Type: A
Name: @  
Value: 99.83.190.102

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: your-actual-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Important:** Make sure you're using your ACTUAL Netlify site URL, not a placeholder.

### Fix 3: Force SSL Certificate Provision
**Problem:** SSL certificate hasn't been provisioned
**Solution:**
1. In Netlify Domain Management
2. Click **Verify** next to your domain
3. If it fails, wait 5 minutes and try again
4. Check **SSL Certificate** section for status

### Fix 4: Clear Browser Cache
